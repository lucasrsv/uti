It's normal for some colic to appear so be careful with him.";
"menstrual_popup_completeDescription" = "During this period, the lining of the uterus (endometrium) that was prepared in the previous cycle is shed in the form of bleeding. This happens because estrogen and progesterone levels are low, which triggers the endometrium to peel. Furthermore, it is at this stage that FSH and LH levels are increased, stimulating the development of ovarian follicles. As the body begins to shed the uterine lining, some people may experience abdominal cramps, fatigue, headaches and breast tenderness.";
"folicular_popup_previewDescription" = "Body Builder Moment! Utinho is preparing for the biggest event of all (ovulation). It is at this time that many resources come together to prepare for this event.";
"folicular_popup_completeDescription" = "After menstruation, the uterus begins to prepare for ovulation. This is when estrogen reaches its maximum level. During this phase, one of the ovarian follicles begins to mature and prepare for ovulation. As the follicle grows estrogen levels gradually increase, this increase in estrogen levels causes the uterine lining to begin to thicken again. At this time, FSH and LH levels begin to decrease after reaching their peak.";
"fertile_popup_previewDescription" = "Alert! Now Utinho is all sassy. After the egg is released, the body is ready for fertilization, so it's normal if it wants to party a lot.";
"fertile_popup_completeDescription" = "Ovulation is marked by the maturation of the follicle, this maturation is responsible for the rupture and release of a mature egg, this happens because there is a sharp increase in estrogen levels, and when reaching its peak, it triggers a rapid increase in LH (peak of LH). This LH surge is what causes the release of the mature egg from the ovary, which is now ready to be fertilized. This phase usually occurs about 14 days before your next period. As at this stage the body prepares for fertilization, it is common to feel an increase in libido and a greater feeling of energy. In addition, there may be a feeling of confidence and greater interest in social interactions.";
"luteal_popup_previewDescription" = "Now, Utinho is preparing a cozy environment, in case there is a special visit (fertilization). If this doesn't happen, Utinho will be ready to dismantle everything and throw it away (menstruation).";
"luteal_popup_completeDescription" = "The luteal phase is crucial both for preparing the uterus for pregnancy and for regulating the start of a new cycle if fertilization does not occur. It occurs in the second half of the menstrual cycle, shortly after ovulation. During this phase, the ovarian follicle that released the egg at ovulation transforms into a structure called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum is responsible for producing the hormone progesterone, which plays a crucial role in preparing the uterus for a possible pregnancy. With the increase in progesterone levels, LH and FSH levels decrease significantly due to their suppressive effects. This happens because at this stage the brain gives inhibitory feedback so that ovulation no longer occurs.";
"pms_popup_previewDescription" = "Now you're the one who has to be careful! With the period coming, be prepared for swelling, stress, irritation and some discomfort.";
"pms_popup_completeDescription" = "After ovulation, if the egg is not fertilized, the body begins to reabsorb the corpus luteum. This causes progesterone and estrogen levels to begin to decline rapidly, which signals the uterine lining to begin shedding. This is the moment when the body goes through the premenstrual moment. This drop in hormone levels can lead to a series of physical, emotional and behavioral symptoms that are characteristic of PMS. Some of the most common symptoms are: swelling, tender breasts and fluid retention. Fatigue, mood swings, irritability and anxiety are also common.";
